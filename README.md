# Warehouse2025

This is a github project to simulate robotic picking zone in fulfillment centers, such as Amazon's KIVA systems. The goal is to evaluate the warehouse's performance in terms of throughput, completion time, etc.

The current task is to generate a dataset of warehouses.

We start with an offline approach and may move to an online approach.
